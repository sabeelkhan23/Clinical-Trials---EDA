# Expolatory Data Analysis on Covid-19 Clinical Trials
Before we dive into the analysis, these are some important key terms needed to understand the entirety of the research analysis.

# Problem Statement

Our analysis is an attempt to demonstrate a step-by-step exploratory data analysis on clinical trials related to COVID 19 studies presented on the https://clinicaltrials.gov/ database site.

These are the key inferential data queries that we were able to tackle and get answers to:

1. To find out the genders in the studies
2. Whether the studies indicate if there is still 'active recruiting' done
3. Identifying the distribution of 'Age ranges' or rather which 'Age bracket' is most studied
4. From which 'Genders' has the most data taken from and if there is any significance in it?
5. In phase1 where there any 'Interesting results' to study?
6. Which clinical trial phases were more applicable?
7. Top countries where clinical trials were conducted?
8. Top 5 drugs mostly tested?
9. In terms of the 'Study Type' which was the most researched and studied?

# Analysis breakdown

The analysis is broken down into various parts to be able to have an incremental approach toward the research queries. Below are the steps we followed to acquire our 9 inferential answers;
